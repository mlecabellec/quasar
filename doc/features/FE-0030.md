    - Buffer, BitBuffer, BufferSlice and BitBufferSlice shall provide methods for conversion from and to quasar::coretypes::Number.
    - Buffer, BitBuffer, BufferSlice and BitBufferSlice shall provide methods for conversion from and to quasar::coretypes::String.
- In quasar::named, add support for a named Buffer and a named BitBuffer (NamedBuffer and NamedBitBuffer).
- In quasar::named, add a NamedBufferSlice and a NamedBitBufferSlice class which are views of a Buffer or BitBuffer.
   - A slice shall be defined by a starting offset and a length.
   - A slice shall be able to be copied to a new Buffer or BitBuffer.
   - A slice shall be able to be concatenated with other slices.
   - A slice shall be able to be sliced at bit level or at byte level depending on the class.

   - Slices can be created from a concatenation of slices of a Buffer or BitBuffer.
   - Tree of slices can be created. Methods for navigating the tree shall be provided.
 - All methods of all classes shall be thread safe. Usage of mutexes with timeout shall be preferred over mutexes with no timeout.
 - All methods of all classes in quasar::coretypes and quasar::named shall be const correct. 
 - All methods of all classes in quasar::coretypes and quasar::named shall be tested.
