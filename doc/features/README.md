Features are splitted by types:

 - Use cases : Use cases are intended to describe the use cases of the Quasar project.
 - Requirements : Requirements are intended to describe the requirements of the Quasar project. Requirements shall be defined by a sentence starting with a verb.
 - Features : Features are intended to describe the features or capabilities of the Quasar project.

 Each feature shall be defined by a file named 'UC-<number>.md' for use cases, 'RQ-<number>.md' for requirements and 'FE-<number>.md' for features.
