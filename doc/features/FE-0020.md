      - When the parent is set, the name shall be added to the parent's children list.
      - When a parent is set, the name shall be unique within the parent object.
    - The lifecycle of the object shall be managed by the parent object.
      - When the parent is destroyed, the object shall be destroyed.
      - When the parent is set, the object shall be added to the parent's children list.

    - the siblings property.
    - the previous sibling property.
    - the next sibling property.
    - the first child property.
    - the last child property.
  - For each class of namespace quasar::coretypes, a derivated class shall be provided which shall also be a derivative of the NamedObject class.
  - Operations on named objects shall be thread safe.
 

Classes shall be associated with "quasar::named" namespace.

Project shall be localted in cmake-projects/named.
