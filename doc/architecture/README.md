# architecture directory

The architecture directory is intended to contain architecture details for the Quasar project.

Architecture is splitted by types:

 - components : Components are intended to describe the components of the Quasar project.
 - constraints : Constraints are intended to describe the constraints of the Quasar project.
 - dependencies : Dependencies are intended to describe the dependencies of the Quasar project.
 - design : Design is intended to describe the design of the Quasar project.
 - interfaces : Interfaces are intended to describe the interfaces of the Quasar project.
 - patterns : Patterns are intended to describe the patterns of the Quasar project.
 - quality : Quality is intended to describe the quality of the Quasar project.
 - requirements : Requirements are intended to describe the requirements of the Quasar project.
 - tools : Tools are intended to describe the tools of the Quasar project.
 - usecases : Use cases are intended to describe the use cases of the Quasar project.

 Each architecture element shall be defined by a file named 'CP-<number>.md' for components, 'CS-<number>.md' for constraints, 'DE-<number>.md' for dependencies, 'DI-<number>.md' for design, 'IF-<number>.md' for interfaces, 'PA-<number>.md' for patterns, 'QU-<number>.md' for quality, 'RE-<number>.md' for requirements, 'TO-<number>.md' for tools, 'UC-<number>.md' for usecases.
