# This file is created whenever the 'start' script or 'make load' is called.  #
# A list of cards detected are included at the end of this file. The user can #
# edit this file to associate a device number to a particular card. In this   #
# way, the user can associate their application device to a specific card.    #
#                                                                             #
# If the user associates a device with a card in this file, they will need    #
# to re-run the 'start' script or 'make' to load the driver module for the    #
# association to take affect. Any invalid association will result in the load #
# failing. User will need to correct the device to card number association    #
# and re-issue the 'start' script or 'make load'.                             #
#                                                                             #
# If the user deletes this file or does not associate any device to a card    #
# prior to issuing the 'start' script or 'make load' the driver will perform  #
# a one to one device to card association.                                    #
#                                                                             #
# User can assign a device number to a card number with the help of either    #
# one of the following formats:                                               #
#                                                                             #
#      Format-A: "device=" or "device_wave=" and "card=" keywords             #
#      Format-B: "device=" or "device_wave=" and "bus=" and "slot=" and       #
#                                             "func=" keywords                #
#                                                                             #
#     For either format, the following rules need to be adhered to:           #
#     - any lines starting with '#' are ignored and deleted by the script.    #
#     - any lines starting with '!' are ignored but not deleted by the script.#
#     - only valid keywords are allowed in an un-commented line.              #
#     - keywords cannot be duplicated for a particular format.                #
#     - device numbers range from '0' to '9'.                                 #
#     - Format-A: card numbers can only range from '0' to 'MAX CARDS DETECTED'#
#     - Format-B: card must reside in specified bus/slot/func numbers         #
#     - device numbers cannot be duplicated as they are used to create        #
#       unique device names.                                                  #
#     - different device numbers can be assigned to the same card number.     #
#     - only those devices are created that are specified by the user         #
#       in this file.                                                         #
#     - if none of the above keywords are specified, the driver will default  #
#       to assiging the device number the same as the card number.            #
#     - the keyword and the number must be separated with '='. No spaces      #
#       are allowed between them.                                             #
#     - keywords can be entered in any order, however, they can only be       #
#       separated by spaces ' ' or commas ','.                                #
#                                                                             #
# When this file is re-created, all lines starting with '#' are deleted.      #
# Users should therefore use '!' instead to retain their comments.            #
#                                                                             #
# e.g. assume 4 cards were detected by the driver:                            # 
#      assume card 4 is located in bus=3, slot=12, func=0                     #
#                                                                             #
#       device=4      card=2                                                  #
#       card=2        device=5                                                #
#       device=3      card=0                                                  #
#       device=1      bus=3, slot=12, func=0                                  #
#       device_wave=3 card=0                                                  #
#                                                                             #
#     In the above example, the following devices will be created.            #
#       /dev/gsc16ao4  device 4 assigned to card=2                            #
#       /dev/gsc16ao5  device 5 also assigned to card=2                       #
#       /dev/gsc16ao3  device 3 assigned to card=0                            #
#       /dev/gsc16ao1  device 1 assigned to card 4 in bus=3, slot=12, func=0  #
#       /dev/gsc16ao_wave3  device_wave 3 assigned to card=0                  #
#                                                                             #
#     Note: card=1 is not assigned and hence cannot be accessed by the user   #
#                                                                             #
