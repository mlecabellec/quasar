# RFM2G API

This directory appears to contain a user-space API and test suite for a "RFM2G" device.

## API Information

*   **Description:** This is likely an API for a Reflective Memory (RFM) device, possibly with a 2-gigabit data rate.
*   **Status:** The directory is very sparse and contains only a boilerplate CppUnit test file. More information is needed to determine the exact purpose and functionality of this API.

## Hardware

Based on the name "RFM2G", this API is likely intended for use with a 2-gigabit Reflective Memory card. Reflective Memory is a type of high-speed networking hardware that allows multiple computers to share a common memory space.

Without more source code or documentation, it is not possible to identify the specific manufacturer or model of the hardware.

## Source Code

*   **Test Code:** The `test` directory contains a single file, `Main.cpp`, which is a boilerplate for a CppUnit test suite.

## Maintenance Notes

*   This directory is incomplete and does not contain enough information to be useful.
*   To understand this module, the full source code for the API and more complete test code are needed.
*   The `rfm2g_lkm` directory may contain the corresponding kernel module for this API.
