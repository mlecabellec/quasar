===============================================================================
1.  Preliminaries
===============================================================================

Abaco Systems avionics provides Linux API distribution packages which are
divided into two sections: first is the Linux support package which consists of
the device drivers and the low-level library (the interface to the device
drivers, this includes USB, and the operating system for the API library(s)).
Second is the API distributions which consist of an API library(s) and examples
demonstrating how to use the library.  All the provided source code is
proprietary and all users must agree and adhere to Abaco Systems' Software
License agreement (refer to the "Partial Source Code" document at
https://www.abaco.com/support/embeddedsupport/legal).

Dependencies
------------
1. The "Condor_Engineering" directory must be the main directory for all
   Abaco Systems avionics API distributions.
2. When the system is restarted both the PCI and/or ISA device driver will need
   to be loaded.  Refer to the "Device Drivers" section.  
3. The low-level library and PCI device driver for kernels 2.6 and 3.x/4.x will
   use the "sysfs" if detected.
4. The low-level library and PCMCIA device driver for kernel 2.6 will use
   "sysfs" if all of the following apply: the "sysfs" is detected, the kernel
   is 2.6.11 or later, and the PCI driver nor the ISA driver is loaded.
5. The USB support requires using the libUSB library that can be installed
   using the Linux distribution software package manager or from the source
   files at libusb.info (this would require modifying the "lowlevel" library
   makefile).  Abaco Systems takes no responsibility for libUSB usage,
   therefore all technical support inquiries concerning this package must be
   directed to the package's admin.
6. The USB support will not use "sysfs" instead it requires using the
   "ceidev.conf" file. 
7. The PCCARD-(D)1553 is a PCIC device and not a cardbus device.  Therefore the
   PCMCIA Card Services may need to be installed on the system.  It is
   available at http://pcmcia-cs.sourceforge.net. Abaco Systems takes no
   responsibility for its usage, therefore all technical support inquiries
   concerning this package must be directed to the package's admin.
8. The distribution is dependent on the following Linux utilities: bash,make,
   gcc, ld, insmod, rmmod.  Abaco Systems takes no responsibility for their
   usage, therefore all questions concerning these packages must be directed
   to the appropriate package admin.

Support
-------
Abaco Systems offers limited Linux support, refer to the "Linux_support.txt"
file for more information.

Source License
--------------
The provided source code is proprietary and subject to the Abaco Systems
Software License Agreement (which can be referenced from
https://www.abaco.com/support/embeddedsupport/legal).  Some of the provided
device drivers for the 2.6 and 3.x/4.x kernel identify themselves as having a
"GPL" license, instead of a "Proprietary" license.  This reference to the "GPL"
license does not supersede or void the Abaco Systems license agreement. If
exception to this is taken, then the Linux kernel 2.4, 2.6, and 3.x/4.x device
drivers, and low-level library will need to be compiled by the user to not
include kernel interfaces exported as "GPL". Refer to the notes in the "Manual
Install" section concerning the device drivers and the low-level library.


===============================================================================
2.  Installation
===============================================================================

Install all of the Abaco Systems avionics boards (except PCMCIA devices) prior
to software installation.
A. Hardware Installation
   ---------------------
    1. Turn OFF your computer system.
    2. Ground yourself before handling the board.  All hardware devices are
       static sensitive.
    3. If installing ISA devices, you will need to set the on-board jumpers for
       the base memory address to an address that is available on the system.
       Refer to the applicable API manual.
    4. Insert the board into any ISA or PCI slot.  Secure it in place with a
       screw on the end panel mounting plate.

B. Software Installation
   ---------------------
    1. Hardware must be installed first.
    2. To install the software you must log on as "root" (can use "su").
    3. Copy the API distribution's compressed tar file (tgz) to a directory.
       The file is located on the API distribution CD-ROM and is available
       at http://www.abaco.com
    4. Uncompress and extract the installation file,
       tar -zxvf <API distribution name>.tgz
       NOTE: 
         refer to the API distribution documentation for the API distribution
         name of the compressed tar file (tgz).

C. Distribution Contents
   ---------------------
    After the tarball extraction completes the following directory structure
    will be created.  Depending on which API distribution is installed:
    ARINC, MIL-STD-1553, or IO will also be created.  Refer to the API
    distribution's documentation for more information.

===============================================================================
3.  Distribution Build
===============================================================================

There are three methods to build the LSP and any detected APIs.  The first
method (automatic install) uses a shell script ("install") which will build and
load everything at once.  The second method is to manually install each part of
the distribution.  It is recommended to use the automatic install but if
problems occur it will be necessary to manually install each part to determine
where the problem is occurring.  The third method is specific for
cross-compiling environments.

NOTE:  If the user does not agree with the "Proprietary/GPL" license usage of
this distribution, then support for the SYS file system will need to be removed
as indicated in the installation procedures.

A.  Automatic install (builds LSP and APIs)
    ---------------------------------------
    1.  Change directory to the "Install" directory.
    2.  There are four bus types arguments for the "install" script:
        a. PCI devices:  ./install
           NOTE:
             the PCI device driver will build and load if the installation
             script detects an Abaco Systems avionics PCI board in the "procfs"
             file system.  If the system does not have a "proc" file system,
             then perform a manual install of the device driver.
        b. ISA devices:  ./install isa <BASEMEM> <IRQ>
            example:  ./install isa 0xd0000 7
                      this programs the driver for the ISA board at 0xd0000.
           NOTE:
             The <BASEMEM> is the base memory address (in hexadecimal) that the
             board's jumpers have been set to.
           NOTE:
             The <IRQ> is optional and is only necessary for boards needing
             hardware interrupt support.
           NOTE:
             If more then one ISA device is installed, refer to the "Loading
             Additional Boards" section.
           NOTE:
             The ISA drivers do not support the "wait queue" functionality for
             hardware interrupt notification, only POSIX signals.
        c. PCMCIA devices:  ./install pcmcia
           NOTE:
             Do not insert a PCCARD-(D)1553 device into the PCMCIA controller
             before running the "install" script.  After the "install" script
             is finished, then insert the PCCARD-(D)1553 device.
           NOTE:
             The "install" script may indicate that the "build_conf" will need
             to be executed after inserting the PCCARD-(D)1553 board(s).
           NOTE:
             To install both an ISA device and a PCMCIA execute:
             ./install pcmcia isa <BASEMEM> <IRQ>
        d. USB devices:  ./install usb
           NOTE:
             Only if it is required to use both channels on the R15-USB device
             concurrently, then instead use "./install usb_server".  This will
             install the USB support to be dependent on the USB server
             functionality, which runs a background process to handle access 
             requests made by the two client processes (one process per channel).
    3.  There are eight configuration arguments that are accepted by the 
        "install" script:
        a. To remove support for SYSFS (the SYS file system), include "no_sysfs"
           in the "./install" command line.
           NOTE:
             If any of the following apply, then SYSFS support must be
             removed: the system does not have the SYS file system, will be using
             an ISA device, will be using a PCCARD-(D)1553 device with a Linux
             kernel before 2.6.11, or using kernel 3.x/4.x or a kernel after
             2.6.10 and user does not agree with the "Proprietary/GPL" license.
        b. To debug the kernel device driver(s), include "debug_drv=<DEBUG LEVEL>"
           in the "./install" command line. The debug statements will be printed
           out to the kernel message log. 
           NOTE:
             The <DEBUG LEVEL> provides increasing debug information with a 
             range of "0" (none) to "3" (all).
        c. To debug the low level library, include "debug_ll" in the
           "./install" command line.  The debug statements will be printed to
           stdout.
        d. To only build the device drivers and libraries, include "no_install"
           in the "./install" command line.
           NOTE:
             If support for SYSFS has been removed, the "ceidev.conf" will not
             be generated. Need to follow the instructions that are displayed 
             on the screen during the installation.  Refer to sub-section 4
             in the next section ("Manual Install") concerning the "ceidev.conf"
             file.
        e. To build the low-level and API libraries as 32-bit libraries to run
           in 32-bit emulation mode for 64-bit systems, include "32bit" in the
           "./install" command line.
        f. To disable hardware interrupt support in the kernel 2.6 PCI/ISA
           drivers or the kernel 3.x/4.x PCI driver, include "no_hwint" in the
           "./install" command line.
        g. To disable using POSIX Real Time signals in the kernel 2.6 PCI/ISA
           drivers or in the kernel 3.x/4.x PCI driver, include "no_hwint_signal"
           in the "./install" command line.
        h. To disable using a "wait queue" for the kernel 2.6 PCI driver or
           the kernel 3.x/4.x PCI driver, include "no_hwint_waitqueue" in the
           "./install" command line.
    4.  The installation is finished.  Check the "install" script output and
        the kernel message log for any errors.  If there are no errors then
        the device driver(s) are loaded into the kernel, the low-level library
        is built as well as all detected API(s) distributions.

B.  Manual install 
    --------------
    1. Build/Load the Device Drivers
       -----------------------------
       1. Change to the applicable driver directory (kernel/bus) in the
          "Drivers" directory.
       2. There are three bus types arguments for building and loading:
           a. PCI devices:  ./install_drv pci
           b. ISA devices:  ./install_drv isa <BASEMEM> <IRQ>
              example:  ./install_drv isa 0xd0000 7
                         this programs the driver for the ISA board at 0xd0000.
              NOTE:
                The <BASEMEM> is the base memory address that the board
                jumpers have been set to.
              NOTE:
                The <IRQ> is optional and is only necessary for MIL-STD-1553
                boards needing hardware interrupt support.
              NOTE:
                If more then one ISA device is installed, refer to the "Loading
                Additional Boards" section.
           c. PCMCIA devices:  ./install_drv pcmcia
              NOTE:
                Do not insert an Abaco Systems avionics PCMCIA device into the
                PCMCIA card reader before running the "install_drv" script.
                After the "install_drv" script is finished, then insert the
                Abaco Systems avionics PCMCIA device.
              NOTE:
                The "build_conf" application can only be used after the
                PCCARD(s) have been inserted into the PCMCIA controller.
       3. There are six configuration arguments that are accepted by the 
          "install_drv" script:
           a. To remove support for SYSFS (the SYS file system), include
              "NO_SYSFS_SUPPORT" in the "./install_drv" command line.
           b. To debug the kernel device driver(s), include "DEBUG=1" in the
              "./install_drv" command line. The debug statements will be
              printed out to the kernel message log. 
           c. To only build the device drivers, include "NO_INSTALL" in the
              "./install_drv" command line. 
           d. To disable hardware interrupt support in the kernel 2.6 PCI/ISA
              drivers or the kernel 3.x/4.x PCI driver, include "NO_HW_INTERRUPT"
              in the "./install_drv" command line.
           e. To disable using POSIX RT signals in the kernel 2.6 PCI/ISA
              drivers or the kernel 3.x/4.x PCI driver, include
              "NO_HW_INTERRUPT_SIGNAL" in the "./install_drv" command line.
           f. To disable using a "wait queue" for the kernel 2.6 or the kernel
              3.x/4.x PCI driver, include "NO_HW_INTERRUPT_WAITQUEUE" in the
              "./install_drv" command line.
       4. There is one configuration option for the kernel 3.x/4.x PCI driver:
           a. To disable the driver from verifying the PID of a process,
              set "DISABLE_PID_VERIFICATION" in the "uceipci.c" file.
       5. To load the device drivers, refer to the "Loading the Device
          Drivers" section.

    2. Build the Low-level library
       --------------------------
       1. Change to the "Lowlevel" directory.
       2. ./install_ll
          There are six configuration arguments that are accepted by the 
          "install_ll" script:
          a. To remove support for SYSFS (the SYS file system), include
             "NO_SYSFS_SUPPORT" in the "./install_ll" command line.  The
             low-level library will then be dependent on the "ceidev.conf" file
             NOTE:
               If any of the following apply, then SYSFS support must be
               removed: the system does not have the SYS file system, will be
               using an ISA device, will be using a PCCARD-(D)1553 device with
               a Linux kernel before 2.6.11, or using a kernel 3.x/4.x or a
               kernel after 2.6.10 and user does not agree with the
               "Proprietary/GPL" license.
          b. To debug the low-level library, include "DEBUG" in the
             "./install_ll" command line.
          c. To only build the low-level library, include "NO_INSTALL" in the
             "./install_ll" command line. 
          d. To build the low-level library as a 32-bit library to run in
             32-bit emulation mode for 64-bit systems, include "32BIT" in the
             "./install_ll" command line.
          e. To build USB support, include "USB_SUPPORT" in the "./install_ll"
             command line.
          f. To build the USB support to handle two channels concurrently, 
             include "USB_SERVER_SUPPORT" in the "./install_ll" commmand line. 

    3. Build the API(s)
       ----------------
       1. Change to the applicable API directory.
       2. ./install_<API name>
          There are three configuration arguments that is accepted by the API
          installation scripts, and two configuration arguments specific for
          the BusTools/1553 API: 
          a. To only build the API library, include "NO_INSTALL" in the
             "./install_<API>" command line. 
          b. To build the API library as a 32-bit library to run in 32-bit
             emulation mode for 64-bit systems, include "32BIT" in the
             "./install_<API>" command line.
          c. To build the API library without support for a "wait queue",
             include "NO_WAITQUEUE" in the "./install_<API>" command line.
          d. To build USB support, include "USB_SUPPORT" in the "./install_1553"
             command line. (BusTools/1553 API only)
          e. To build the USB support to handle two channels concurrently, 
             include "USB_SERVER_SUPPORT" in the "./install_1553" commmand
             line.  (BusTools/1553 API only)
       NOTE:
         Refer to the API distribution's documentation for more information.

    4. Generate a "ceidev.conf" file (if no SYSFS support)
       ---------------------------------------------------
       1. Change to the "Install" directory.
       2. make -f makeconf
          There are six makefile options:
          a. For a 2.6 kernel, add "KERNEL=26" to the command line.
          b. For a 3.x/4.x kernel, add "KERNEL=30" to the command line.
          c. For a ppc architecture, add "ARCH=ppc".
          d. For a x86_64 architecture, add "ARCH=x86_64".
          e. For a x86_64 architecture, add "ARCH=ppc64".
          f. To build a 32-bit application to run on a 64-bit system, add
             "32BIT" to the command line.
       3. ./build_conf
       NOTE:
         For ISA devices append "isa" and for PCMCIA devices append "pcmcia".
       NOTE:
         The device driver(s) need to be loaded for the application to function.
       NOTE:
         Refer to "The configuration file" section for more information.
       NOTE:
         For USB devices append "USB".  Since the USB device will not be
         operational when the "ceidev.conf" is configured, it might require
         modification.  Either modify the "build_conf.c" file or after the file
         is created modify the "ch0" and "func0" variables.

C.  Cross-compile environment
    -------------------------
    Do not use any of the install shell scripts in the distribution, since they 
    will query the host system for its environmental variables and not the
    target system.  Refer to the "Automatic install" and "Manual install"
    sections for explanation of configuration arguments. 
    1. Device drivers
       NOTE: these instructions are only applicable to the kernel 2.6 PCI/ISA
             drivers and the kernel 3.x/4.x PCI driver, other drivers will need
             their makefiles modified.
       a. set the makefile option "MODULE_PATH=" to the path for the kernel
          source used by the target system.
       b. additional configuration arguments: add "SYSFS=1" to support the SYS
          file system.
       c. may need to modify the "load_pci" shell script for the path to "insmod".
       NOTE: the "load_pci" shell script is intended to be executed on the target
             system that has the board inserted to load its device driver.
    2. Low-level library
       a. add "ARCH=" with a supported architecture and "CROSS_COMPILE=" with
          the appropriate toolchain to the command line for the makefile.
       b. additional configuration arguments: add "KERNEL=24" for a 2.4 kernel,
          add "SYSFS=1" to support the SYS file system.
    3. API library
       a. add "ARCH=" with a supported architecture and "CROSS_COMPILE=" with
          the appropriate toolchain to the command line for the makefile.
    4. API examples
       a. add "ARCH=" with a supported architecture and "CROSS_COMPILE=" with
          the appropriate toolchain to the command line for the makefile.
       b. additional configuration arguments: add "NO_INSTALL=1" to link
          examples to the "low level" and API libraries in located in the local
          directory or in their designate directories of the distribution.
    5. "ceidev.conf" (if no SYSFS support)
       a. add "ARCH=" with a supported architecture and "CROSS_COMPILE=" with
          the appropriate toolchain to the command line for the makefile.
       b. additional configuration arguments: add "KERNEL=26" for a 2.6 kernel
          or "KERNEL=30" for a 3.x/4.x kernel, add "32BIT" to build as a 32-bit
          application for a 64-bit system.
       NOTE: the "build_conf" application is intended to be executed on the
             target system that have the boards inserted.


===============================================================================
4.  Device Drivers
===============================================================================

The device drivers for Abaco Systems avionics boards must be loaded for the
APIs to communicate with the board.  When the system is restarted both the PCI
and/or ISA device driver will need to be loaded, but the PCMCIA device driver
will not need to be loaded each time.

A.  Loading the Device Driver
    -------------------------
    1. Change to the applicable driver directory (kernel/bus) in the "Drivers"
       directory.
    2. There are three options for loading:
       a. PCI devices:  ./load_pci
       b. ISA devices:  ./load_isa <BASEMEM> <IRQ>
          example: ./load_isa 0xd0000 7
                   this programs the driver for the ISA board at 0xd0000.
          NOTE:
            The <BASEMEM> is the base memory address that the board's jumpers
            have been set to.
          NOTE:
            The <IRQ> is optional and is only necessary for MIL-STD-1553 boards
            needing hardware interrupt support.
          NOTE:
            If more then one ISA device is installed, refer to the "Loading
            Additional Boards" section.
       c. PCMCIA devices:  ./load_pcmcia
          NOTE:
            The PCMCIA client driver does not needed to be loaded at system
            start.  It is only mentioned here since the installation procedure
            calls it and if problems occur.
    3. There is one configuration argument that is accepted by the "load_pci" and 
       "load_isa" scripts:
       a. To debug the kernel device driver(s), include "DEBUG=<DEBUG LEVEL>"
          in the "./load_pci" or "./load_isa" command line. The debug
          statements will be printed out to the kernel message log.
           NOTE:
             For the kernel 3.x/4.x and 2.6 drivers the <DEBUG LEVEL> provides
             increasing debug information with a range of "0" (none) to "3"
             (all).
           NOTE:
             For the kernel 2.4 drivers the <DEBUG LEVEL> is either "0" (none)
             or "1" (all).

B.  Unloading the Device Driver
    ---------------------------
    1. Change to the applicable driver directory (kernel/bus) in the "Drivers"
       directory.
    2. There are three options for unloading:
       a. PCI devices:  ./unload_pci
       b. ISA devices:  ./unload_isa
       c. PCMCIA devices:  ./unload_pcmcia


===============================================================================
5.  Loading Additional Boards
===============================================================================

The PCI device driver will support up to 8 boards, the ISA device driver will
support up to 4 boards, and the PCMCIA driver up to 2 boards.  There is no need
to make the drivers for each board, nor is it necessary to load the drivers for
each board.  The only driver that needs additional information is the ISA driver
which takes the base memory address and irq (if needed) for each board.

In the applicable ISA driver (Linux kernel) directory: 
  ./load_isa 0xXXXXX,0xXXXXX,0xXXXXX,0xXXXXX X,X,X,X

example (two Q104-1553 boards): ./load_isa 0xD0000,0xE0000 7,9


===============================================================================
6.  The configuration file
===============================================================================

The configuration file "ceidev.conf" (located in the local path or in the 
"Condor_Engineering" directory) provides information from the device drivers to
the API concerning information about the boards that are installed in the
system.  This file is necessary if any of the following apply: for Linux kernel
2.4 systems, Linux kernel 2.6 or 3.x/4.x systems that do not have support for
the "sysfs" file system, for all Abaco Systems avionics USB and ISA devices,
and for the Abaco Systems PCCARD-(D)1553 on systems with Linux kernels before
2.6.11.  The "ceidev.conf" file can be written manually, or can be generated by
the "build_conf" application.  By default the "build_conf" app will check for
PCI devices, for USB device append "usb", for ISA devices append "isa", and for
PCMCIA devices append "pcmcia".

The following lines need to be present and correct for every board installed,
or the board will not function or have limited functionality:
  id<device>=<X>
  ch<device>=<X>    (applies only to Bustools/1553 API)
  func<device>=<X>  (applies only to Bustools/1553 API)
  bus<device>=<X>   (applies only to Bustools/1553 API)
  minor<device>=<X>
  irig<device>=<X>  (applies only to Bustools/1553 API)
  csc<device>=<X>   (applies only to Bustools/1553 API)
  drv<device>=<driver>_<minor>
  devnum=<X>

  Description:	
    <device> = The device (logical) number for the board.  This is the value
               that is used by the low-level to identify the board to the APIs.
               Valid range: 0 to 7
    id: The board identification value in decimal (converted from a hex value): 
        * Bustools/1553 API refer to the "busapi.h" file.
        * CEI-x20, CEI-x30 and P-708 API: take the part number in hex and covert
          to decimal, for the CEI-820TX add "1". example: CEI-820 (0x820) = 2080
        * P-SER: 4100 (hex 0x1004)
        * P-DIS: 4102 (hex 0x1006)
    ch: The number of available channels on the board.
    func: Identifies a single-function ('0') or multi-function board ('1').
    bus: The bus used by the board: ISA ('1'), PCI ('2'), PCMCIA ('4'), USB ('5').
    minor: The minor number in the dev file system.  The operating system will
           assign the first board '0' and each sequential board an incremented
           value.  Valid range: '0' to '7'
    irig: Identifies if irig functionality is present ('1').
    csc: The "Control/Status Configuration" register.
    drv: The device (logical) number for the board in the APIs.
         <minor> = same value as minor.
         <driver> = The name of the device driver for the board: uceipci,
                    uceiisa, cei_pcc1553_cs, libusb.
    devnum: Identifies how many Abaco Systems avionics devices are installed.

===============================================================================
7. Troubleshooting
===============================================================================

When installing any API distribution, you will need to be logged on as "root".
Use the "su" command to gain "root" permissions.  Root permissions are
necessary when building device drivers and loading the modules into the kernel.

Useful Linux system utilities 
-----------------------------
 dmesg:   displays the kernel message log. 
 lsmod:   displays the current modules loaded in the kernel
 lspci:   displays the PCI config space for all PCI devices
 cardmgr: controls the PCMCIA card manager (part of PCMCIA Card Services).
 strace:  displays the system calls that the driver or application calls.
 ltrace:  displays the calls to the dynamic libraries that the application calls.
 gdb:     the GNU debugger.
 modinfo: displays the module information for a driver.
 
Compilation
-----------
1. If there are compilation errors, check that the path to the kernel headers
   is valid.  If different than the default ("/lib/modules/<KERNEL>/build"),
   include the path in the applicable driver's makefile by including a "-I"
   with the path.
2. If there are system calls that cannot be resolved, check the
   "/proc/kallsyms" file to verify that they are compiled into the kernel.

Run-time
--------
1. Check that the device drivers (uceipci, uceiisa, and/or cei_pcc1553_cs) are
   loaded with "lsmod".
2. Examine the kernel message log for error output from the device drivers
   (uceipci, uceiisa, or cei_pcc1553_cs).  Use "dmesg" and/or look directed at
   the kernel message log located in "/var/log/messages".
3. If there are version errors when loading the drivers, the driver's version
   string (magic) may not coincide with current running kernel.  Use
   "modinfo" to get the driver's magic number.  Refer to the 
   "/usr/src/linux/makefile" and "/usr/src/linux/.config".
4. To determine where an error may be occurring in the application or API
   libraries use "gdb".  Make sure when compiling to provide the "-g" to GCC.
5. If a device driver fails to unload with "modprobe", use "rmmod".  
6. If loading the kernel 2.6 or 3.x/4.x PCI device driver and receive errors
   indicating missing symbols with "sysfs" in the symbol name, then build the
   distribution without support for SYSFS.
